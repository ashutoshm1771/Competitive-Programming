Z-SERIES

Hanifa was studying functional mathematics. While studying, she got introduced to a Z-series. The Z-series is defined as follows : Z[i] = Z[i-1] + Z[i-2] + 1. For example, {2,3,6,10} is a Z series. Hanifa is given few numbers. Her task is find out the Z-series, with maximum size, out of the given numbers. If there are multiple Z-series with maximum size, print the Z-series with smallest number. Help poor Hanifa out!

Input Format

The first line contains N - (the number of elements) Second line contains an array of N elements.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000

1 <= A[i] <= 1000, for each i ( 1 <= i <= N)

Output Format

Print the Z-series with maximum size, in a single line, separated by space.

The possible Z-series of size 3 are :
    2 3 6
    2 4 7
    2 7 10
    3 6 10
    4 5 10
The possible Z-series of size 4 are :
    2 3 6 10
Since it is the only Z-series of the longest size, we print it as the output.
