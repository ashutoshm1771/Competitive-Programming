XOR Game 

Today, as a friendship gift, Bhavana gave Ramya n integers a1,a2,…,an and challenged her to choose an integer X such that the value max( 1 ≤ i ≤ n (ai⊕X)) is minimum possible, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

As always, Ramya is too lazy, so you decided to help her and find the minimum possible value of max(1 ≤ i ≤ n(ai⊕X)).

Input Format

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 2^30−1).

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5

0 ≤ ai ≤ (2^30)−1 , for 1<=i<=n

Output Format

Print one integer — the minimum possible value of max. 1 ≤ i ≤ n(ai⊕X).
