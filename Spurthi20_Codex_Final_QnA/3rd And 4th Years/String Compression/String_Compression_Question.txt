String Compression

Ms. Hashmi is preparing for her speech contest. She encounters a sentence(in the form of a string, without separation), with repeated or non-repeated letters. She felt bored to count the numbers of repetition of similar consecutive letters in her speech. So she requested you to write a program that manages the string as given below :

Sentence : aaabbbbcccdaaeeeeb

Format : a3b4c3d1a2e4b1

She wants the numbers of total entities in the format above. For the above instance, it would be 14( count(a,3,b,4,c,3,d,1,a,2,e,4,b,1) ).

Note that even if the number extends single digit, the count remains 1 for it. Instance, aabbbbbbbbbbbcc would be a2b11c3. Yet, the count would remain 6.

Input Format

First line contains the number of test-cases t.

t lines follow:

Each line of a test-case contains a string.

Constraints

1 <= t <= 10^4

1 <= length(string) <= 100

Output Format

For each test case, print the total number of entities in the format mentioned in the description above, in each line.

Sample Input 0

2
aabbbcdda
bbbccccccccccccd
Sample Output 0

10
6
Explanation 0

For the first example, the format is a1b3c1d2a1. So the number of entities becomes 10.
For the second example, the format is b3c12d1. So the number of entities becomes 6.
