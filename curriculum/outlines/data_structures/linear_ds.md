# Linear DS
---
## Outline
1. Static Arrays
	 1. Creating 1D, 2D, ND Static Arrays.
	 2. Accessing Time.
	 3. Traversing a static array with N dimensions.
	 4. 1D Array Manipulation.
	 5. 2D Array Manipulation.
	 	* Example: Rotating a matrix.
	 6. Tricks and Pitfalls.
	 
2. Dynamically-Resizable Arrays
	 1. Creating ArrayLists.
	 2. Important functions and their complexities:
	 	* `add, get, set, set, indexOf, size`
	 2. How resizing is done internally + resizing complexity.
	 5. Using Static Arrays with Dynamically-Resizable Arrays.
	 	* `ArrayList<Integer> a[]`
		
3. Bitmasks
	1. Bits as a data structure.
	2. Bit Manipulation.	
	
4. BitSets
	1. Important functions and their complexities:
		* `reset, set, cardinality, flip, nextSetBit, xor`
	2. Core idea behind BitSets.
	
5. LinkedLists
	1. Important functions and their complexities:
		* `get, add, remove`
		
6. Stacks
	1. Important functions and their complexities.
		* `pop, push, peek, isEmpty`
	2. Applications on Stacks.
	
7. Queues
	1. Important functions and their complexities.
	2. Applications on Queues.
	
8. Dequeues
