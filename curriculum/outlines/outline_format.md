# Outline Checklist

1. Create a file in the following path `curriculum/outlines/[category]/[topic_name]`.
    - [category] and [topic_name] are specified in the preparation drafts.
2. Write the file title with the topic name.
    - use H1 followed by a horizontal line.
3. Make three sections with titles [Outline, Material Resources, Problem Sets].
    - use H3 and separate them by horizontal lines.
4. Add all topic points, subpoints, examples... etc in the outline section.
    - use bullets and numbers.
    - don't get into details if they are well-explained in the material provided.
    - add the recommended in-session examples below correct subpoints, maybe link will be needed.
5. Add material resources.
    - make a table with two columns [Resource, Points covered].
    - In resource, write a shorthand name for the link content.
    - In Points covered, write the point(s) number and optionally a shorthand point description.
6. Add the problem sets
    - Problem set Structure:
        - col 1: problem name and link
        - col 2: tags - all tags except the main tag (outline topic)
        - col 3: notes [VERY IMPORTANT] - hints, main outcome/idea, problems in the problem statement or its input.
        - col 4: solution link
    - Three problem sets are needed:
        - Problem Set 1: 
            - must-solve problems. Every problem must add a new thing.
            - Must cover the content of the topic.
            - problems count >= 5 * acm_days.
        - Problem Set 2:
            - extra problems. These problems will be solved by hard-working trainees.
            - It’s strictly recommended that they have new ideas.
            - problems count <= 5 * acm_days.
        - Problem Set 3 (optional): 
            - redundant ideas. These problems will be solved by trainees who solved problem set 1 but still not confident of this topic.
     - Use the problems in the old plans. If you want to remove any of them, please write them down in the merge request with the reason of their removal (a better version including the problem trick is added, doesn’t add a new thing… etc).
     - Extra problems that depend on other topics or are difficult at the current level, should be added in the general problems sheet.
7. Make a pull request!

### Tips and auxilary material
- Markdown [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- See this [outline sample](https://github.com/AhmadElsagheer/Competitive-programming-library/blob/master/curriculum/outlines/data_structures/linear_ds.md).
- You can use the [problems sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1blSbPr1pAFZSzlAi2IVdTeytz2yO7Ejx9SeQWOSxY0w/edit#gid=1542041463) and [topics sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLEm58_2bQgM7qhATSjN0fGbdLLtaOCjUFnTGniHbjI/edit#gid=0) for help.
- Act like as if you are going to conduct the session. You will first write main points down. Then you will add subpoints. Then you will add examples. Then you will add pitfalls and tricks that are most probably not mentioned anywhere, but gained by experience.
