### Notes
- To find the problems:
    - For CF problems, if problem is 71A, then it's link will be "http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/71/A".
    - For UVa problems, just google "UVA [problem id]" and you will get links for the problem. Make sure that the same id appears in the problem page written before the problem name.
    - - For extra problems about the mentioned topics, check CP or [problems sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1blSbPr1pAFZSzlAi2IVdTeytz2yO7Ejx9SeQWOSxY0w).
    
- Resources:
    - CP is [Competitive Programming 3](https://cpbook.net/).
    - CLRS is [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms).
    - For extra resources, check [awesome-list](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming) or [topics sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLEm58_2bQgM7qhATSjN0fGbdLLtaOCjUFnTGniHbjI).
    
- Solutions and hints:
    - For CF problems, you can see other accepted submissions.
    - For UVa problems, check [this repo](https://github.com/AhmadElsagheer/UVa-Solutions) or google it.
