9. Using a for loop, write a program that prints out the decimal equivalents of 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, . . . ,1/10
Output must be in the form
               : 1/2 = 0.5
                 1/3 = 0.333
				 1/4 = 
				 .
				 .
				 .
				 .
				 1/10 = 0.1
10. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
11. Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
12. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and
generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:
[34, 67, 55, 33, 12, 98]
(34, 67, 55, 33, 12, 98)
13. Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated
sequence.
Example
Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180
The output of the program should be:
18,22,24
(If the output received is in decimal form, it should be rounded off to its nearest value 
(for example, if the output received is 26.0, it should be printed as 26))
14.Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world
15.Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after
making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world
Practice makes perfect
Then, the output should be:
HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
16.Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world
17. Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world!
Then, the output should be:
UPPER CASE 1
LOWER CASE 9
18. Write a program that computes the value of a+aa+aaa+aaaa with a given digit as the value of a.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
9
Then, the output should be:
11106
19. Find the sum of all the primes below 20,000.
20. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four
million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
21. Python Program to Calculate the Number of Words, Number of Characters and whitespace present in   a String
22. Python Program to Take in Two Strings and Display the Larger String without Using Built-in Functions
23. Python Program to Form a New String Made of the First 2 and Last 2 characters From a Given String
24. Python Program to Replace all Occurrences of ‘a’ with $ in a String
25. Python Program to replace a each vowel with any other character
